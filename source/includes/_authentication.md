# Authentication

To authenticate to the Memre API, you will need an API key. Your customer success manager can provide you with one.

Memre expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header. The header should look like:

`Authorization: Bearer cDPuiaEQrttyDpGU8a1aJtltFUDJY9W31Hi/K+SY9c2WuqHio3dBVtBjagLxyh6U`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>cDPuiaEQrttyDpGU8a1aJtltFUDJY9W31Hi/K+SY9c2WuqHio3dBVtBjagLxyh6U</code> with your API key.
